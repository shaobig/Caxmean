# Caxmean
Caxmean is a mobile application on the Android platform that helps a user to study and acquire foreign words based on the repetition strategy. A word registered in the system can be represented as an auxiliary entity called "Card". This term alludes to the flashcard - one of the most famous objects of the memorisation technique which enhances the long-term memory and expands the vocabulary power. 

Caxmean recommends and prompts a user to utilise a strict but more effective Leitner system _(see picture 1)_ for the repetitive exercises. Continuous and persistent education during the long period of time may reinforce the memory and fix firmly the vocabulary or the key information.

## User story
- As a user I can create a card that includes five meanings on the one side and five translations on the other side associated by a flashcard entity;
- If something needs to be corrected, the user can activate the context menu in order to add, edit and delete the information about the card via UI;
- As a user I'm able to keep and store a list of cards inside the card collection;
- The user can edit the information like card collection name or priority value. The manipulations with the date properties including "creation time" and "updated time" are managed by the application logic.
